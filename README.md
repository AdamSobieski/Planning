## Representing Planning Domains

New techniques for modeling planning domains and problems could be explored such that these new techniques and representations could transpile to existing formats such as [PDDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDDL). Transpiling to PDDL could occur from [source code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code), [abstract-syntax trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree), [.NET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework) [assemblies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_(CLI)), or [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) [JARs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAR_(file_format)).

Advantages of representing planning domains and problems in assemblies or JARs include that multiple languages could be compiled to these while PDDL would be one key language to be decompiled from these.
